Dear All

AOA. I am sure all of you will enjoy your Data Structures' project :).

Enclosed in this folder are data files. 

Every file contains multiple records / rows.

Every row contains seven (07) tab separated attributes/columns in the order:

RollNum, Name, DoB, Gender, RegistrationDate, Address, LastQualification

Good Luck :)

Regards,
Maheen
